# <font color="blue"> nerdKid </font> :clown_face:

This project is inspired by the works of [entity-fishing](https://github.com/kermitt2/entity-fishing) and [grobid-ner](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-ner). Entity-fishing is a tool to automate a recognition and disambiguisation task while grobid-ner is a named-entity recogniser based on the [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) library, a machine learning library for extracting, parsing and re-structuring raw documents such as PDF into structured TEI-encoded documents with a particular focus on technical and scientific publications.
 
**nerdKid** project focuses on the classification of entities into their types (e.g. Person, Location), [grobid-ner Classes](https://grobid-ner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/class-and-senses/) with the use of Wikidata as online knowledge base.

# Goal
According to [Wikidata's statistics](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Statistics), more than one hundred million items can be found in Wikidata. With its rich and open knowledge base, it's interesting to learn how those items can be classified into 27 classes. These classes are based on [Grobid-NER](http://grobid-ner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/class-and-senses/) 's project results.

The idea of this project is to make computers <font color="red"> understand </font> how grouping millions of items in Wikidata into specific classes based on their data characteristics.

Let's take an example of an item [Albert Einstein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937) in Wikidata which has an identifier 'Q937'. This item actually has a number of properties (e.g. 'instance of-P31', 'sex or gender-P21', etc.) as well as a number of values for each property (e.g. 'human-Q5' as a value of property 'P31', 'male-Q6581097' as a value of property 'P-21'). Based on a trained given model, computers will understand how making some predictions and classifying the Albert Einstein's item into a certain class, Person class, for instance. This project will also consider disambiguity of items. For instance, computers will not classify [Marshall Plan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4576) into a Person class, because it's not a name of a person, rather it's an American initiative to aid Western Europe.

# Tools

![Developing Tools](pic/Tools.jpg)

# Installation-Build-Run
**1. Installation**

*a. Clone this source* 

```$ git clone https://github.com/tantikristanti/NERD_KID.git```

*b. Download the zip file*

[NERD_KID](https://github.com/tantikristanti/NERD_KID/archive/master.zip)

**2. Build the project**

```$ mvn clean install```

# Training and Evaluation

For the training purpose, 9922 items of Wikidata were chosen. From these examples, 80% were used for the training purpose and the rest for the evaluation. 
The accuracy obtained from the current model is 92,091%. Furthermore, the FMeasure result for each class type can be seen as follows:

<img width="350" height="550" alt = "Developing Tools" src="pic/EvaluationNerdKid.jpg"/>

Since the examples were taken randomly, a number of class types did not have enough examples. This is the reason a number of classes have 0 for their FMeasure.

<!-- # Create New Training Data
**1. Build a training Arff file**
- In order to build a new training data, this service can be used:

```$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.nerd.kid.arff.TrainerGenerator"```

*(Basically, a training file built based on the datasets prepared in ![Base Elements](data/csv/BaseElements.csv) 
 This step is done if there isn't any training file or there is a need to build a new one.)*

- The result of Arff file can be seen in ![Training](result/arff/Training.arff) 
- It is also possible to check first whether the data and features of wikidata Ids are correct/complete by checking the Csv file result located in ![Result From Arff Generator](result/csv/ResultFromArffGenerator.csv)  
  
**2. Build, train, and evaluate the model**

*Model training using Random Forest classification [SMILE](https://github.com/haifengl/smile/)*

```$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.nerd.kid.model.ModelBuilder"```

- The evaluation result can be seen in ![Result_Trained_Model](result/txt/Result_Trained_Model.txt) 
- The model itself can be found in Xml and Zip format which are located in the temporary file `/tmp` and they can be copied to ![Resources](src/main/resources) directory

**3. Prepare new data to be predicted**

The prediction service provided by Nerd-Kid can be done if the list of new Wikidata Id is available in ![New Elements](data/csv/hasBeenCorrected/NewElements.csv).
In order to do so, there are some possibilities of:
    a. Filling manually the list of Wikidata Ids and their Classes  
    
   The file is actually a very simple csv file that contain Wikidata Id and just leave the Class empty with comma separator. For example:
    
    ```
    WikidataID,Class
    Q76,
    Q1408,
    ```
    
   b. If some texts are available, using Nerd and Grobid-Ner service to get Wikidata Ids and their Classes 
     
   *New data can be collected by extracting the text with the text disambiguation service of [Entity-Fishing](http://nerd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/restAPI.html)*
    
   - Firstly, the ***text*** and the ***language*** need to be input in order to get some mentions and disambiguation results in Json format
        - The example of the text can be seen here ![Text Example](data/txt/exampleText.txt) 
        - If the language is not mentioned, the text will be processed as English text by default.
        - The raw Json result from Entity-Fsihing can be seen in ![Entity-Fishing Text Disambiguation](data/json/Result_EntityFishingTextDisambiguation.json) 
        
   - Secondly, the result from the previous step will be parsed in order to get a list of Wikidata Ids and their classes
        - The list of Wikidata Ids and Classes can be seen in ![New Elements](data/csv/NewElements.csv) 
        - It is a very simple csv file that contain Wikidata Ids and their classes. For example:
        
    ```
    WikidataID,Class
    Q76,PERSON
    Q1408,LOCATION
    ```

   These 2 tasks can be done by this service:
    ```$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.nerd.kid.service.NerdClient"```
-->

# Get the prediction results

To predict each Wikidata Id prepared in ![New Elements](data/csv/NewElements.csv), this service can be called:


```$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.nerd.kid.model.WikidataNERPredictor"```

- The result can be seen in ![Result Predicted Class](result/csv/ResultPredictedClass.csv)

# Demo version

For testing purposes, Nerd-Kid is available here [Nerd-Kid](http://nerd.huma-num.fr/kid/service/ner?id=Q1) 

User can only just change the Wikidata Id started with 'Q' and then the number.

![Prediction Result](pic/ResultPredictionWeb.jpg)

- The result will be Wikidata Id, the properties, and the result of predicted class.

# Use **nerdKid** Service in Other Projects
**nerdKid** prepares ways to be used in other projects:

1.Make sure **nerdKid** is built `$ mvn clean install`

2.Add the dependency to **nerdKid** in the pom file of other projects :

```
<dependency>
<groupId>org.nerd.kid</groupId>
<artifactId>nerd-kid-project</artifactId>
<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>log4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

To prevent some errors due to the overlapping of Maven dependencies like for example *slf4j*, do some steps explained here [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html) :
- Declare the exclusion of commons-logging in the provided scope

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>commons-logging</groupId>
    <artifactId>commons-logging</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.1</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>jcl-over-slf4j</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0-alpha1</version>
</dependency>
```

- And ignore other slf4j dependency (or simply mark them as comments)

3.Add **nerdKid** library (nerd-kid-project) under `lib/org/nerd/kid`. 
    This library is built as the deployment result and is saved under `.m2/repository/org/nerd/kid/`

4.Call the prediction service :

For predicting NER type, **nerdKid** needs to collect the statements for each Wikidata element. These statements are collected from *entity-fishing* service. 
There are several ways to collect the statements:
-	Collect from [entity-fishing](http://nerd.huma-num.fr/nerd/service/kb/concept) 
-	Collect from localhost `http://localhost:8090/service/kb/concept`
-	Collect from LMDB data of *entity-fishing* (data/db/db-kb), [entity-fishing-documentation](https://nerd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#install-build-and-run) 

In this case, new classes as implementation of an interface called `WikidataFetcherWrapper` in **nerdKid**  need to be created and the `WikidataElement getElement(String wikiId)` method needs to be adapted as needed.

a.	Example of using **nerdKid** service by default :

```
WikidataFetcherWrapper wrapper = new NerdKBFetcherWrapper();
WikidataNERPredictor wikidataNERPredictor = new WikidataNERPredictor(wrapper);
System.out.println(wikidataNERPredictor.predict("Q1077").getPredictedClass());
```

b.	Example of using **nerdKid** service by running *entity-fishing* on localhost (default port on 8090) :

To use this way, *entity-fishing* needs to be run `$ mvn clean jetty:run`, see [entity-fishing-documentation](https://nerd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#install-build-and-run)
  
```
WikidataFetcherWrapper wrapper = new NerdKBLocalFetcherWrapper();
WikidataNERPredictor wikidataNERPredictor = new WikidataNERPredictor(wrapper);
System.out.println(wikidataNERPredictor.predict("Q1077").getPredictedClass());
```
